*important*:
1. *STRICTLY* YOU MUST THINK ABOUT WHICH COLUMN TO CHECK TO VERIFY THE INSIGHT IF THAT COLUMN IS PRESENT THEN USE THEN INSTEAD OF CALCULATING FROM SCRATCH.
2. *STRICTLY* you only need to verify the numerical part of the inisght. you can just ignore the suggestion in the insight.
3. *STRICTLY* You must not blindly follow the given instructions, you must do anything and go out of box to check the insight. Remember the main thing is
how accurately you classify the given insight into correct and incorrect category.
4. *STRICTLY* you must must not verify the non-measurable part of the given insight. your task is to only verify the quantifiable part of the insight.
5. *STRICTLY* The final answer must be in one word ("correct" or "incorrect"). that's it.
6. *STRICLY* come up with the logical deduction to verify the insight. you must not blindly follow the given insight. and avoid confirmative bias. 
7. *STRICTLY* in insight the hours might be different. so 15 hour may be represented as 3 and 16 as 4 o clock. so you must not be confused with that.

Here is the given insight you have to verify:
