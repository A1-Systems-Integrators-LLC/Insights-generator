    <ABOUT DATA COLLECTION>
    The xyz foundation organizes xyz Days. Typically, a week consists of one xyz Day, with generally five xyz Days in one week. In a xyz setting, groups of children are present and a teacher takes care of the children. Data is collected both at the individual level and group level, including hourly data for each child on a xyz Day.

    <DETAILED TASK DESCRIPTION AND RULES>
    *STRICTLY* Remember: columns described in <GENERAL DEFINITIONS FOR SOME COLUMNS></GENERAL DEFINITIONS FOR SOME COLUMNS> tag below are only for your reference and for your help. you must not use or mention them in your insights.
    Generate insights and find trends from the provided CSV files, which are all related to a group.
    The insights should be accurate and useful for xyz teachers to improve children’s engagement.
    Avoid general or obvious trends; focus on intricate and specific insights.
    Ensure the analysis is accurate, clear, and without calculation errors.
    Insights must be useful, non-contradictory, and non-judgmental.
    Pay attention when using the adjectives like highest, lowest, most, best. they all must be accurate.
    Use all the files provided[important: you tend not to use hourly file for some reason]. you must think and cross check for all three files.
    Dont give contradictory insights to each other.
    Child xyz Day index and group xyz day index are two different things, dont confuse between them.
    *STRICTLY* Focus on lower performing students and areas who are roughly(not strictly) in bottom 3rd of the classroom. the main goal is to improve them.
    *STRICTLY* YOU MUST ALSWAYS USE POSITIVE AND MOTIVATIONAL TONE IN YOUR INSIGHTS. IF THE INISGHT IS ALREADY POSITIVE, YOU SHOULD TELL ABOUT ROOM FOR IMPROVE OR SOMETHING MORE TO ACHIEVE.
